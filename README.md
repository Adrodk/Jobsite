# Job Search Site

This React job search site incorporates a local JSON file as a
            database, enabling users to access a comprehensive listing of
            available job opportunities. In addition to browsing existing job
            listings, users also have the ability to post new job openings and
            delete outdated or filled positions directly on the site.
